## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
N/a

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I have never used javascript so the syntax for function parameters and other basic things were a little confusing. I got over this by reading over the supplied code and mimicking the syntax from there.
I also am currently in a time crunch as I have two midterms next week so I definetely struggled with taking the time to read through the instructions thoroughly and did not write the cleanest code.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I am curious now about how css files manage websites as different pages on the same organizational websites have very different buttons and appearances. Are multiple css files needed or is everything included in the same file using hidden classes as we used for the start, stop button.
I also am curious about how apis are implemented in web development. For example many webpages use a map feature from google or apple maybe and I would love to learn about how I could use such a feature in a website of my own. 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I am currently studying for midterms and wish I had more time to play around with the game rules. I would want to increase playback speed each level and implement a time limit on responses.
Additionally I would have added two more buttons so I could implement a full scale of buttons and have the pattern be a more challenging song. I also think it would have been interesting to work on the button layout so that I could format the buttons as a keyboard.
This program reminds me of learning piano and I wonder if a piano like layout with buttons linked to keys on the keyboard would be helpful in learning new songs especially for kids. In this way the patterns could be availible as arrays of songs and maybe the buttons could be pressed simultaneously to simulate chords.
